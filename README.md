Express.js and MongoDB RESTful API
This project implements a simple RESTful API using Express.js and MongoDB. The API allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of items in a MongoDB database.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js
MongoDB
Installation
Clone this repository or download the project files.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install

Configuration
Before running the project, you may need to configure the MongoDB connection settings. Open the server.js file and modify the MongoDB connection URL to match your MongoDB server configuration:

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
Start your MongoDB server.

In the project directory, run the following command to start the Express.js server:
npm run start
The server will start running on http://localhost:3004 (or the specified port number).

You can use a tool like Postman or cURL to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

API Endpoints

GET /api/items - Retrieve all items from the database.
GET /api/items/:id - Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
POST /api/items - Create a new item in the database.
PUT /api/items/:id - Update an existing item by its ID.
DELETE /api/items/:id - Delete an item by its ID.
For the POST and PUT requests, the request body should be in JSON format and include the following fields: name (string) and description (string).

Error Handling
The API handles common errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. If an error occurs, the response will be in JSON format with an error field.
